Process - 
1. Wrote the basic code to ask password from user and then show the input also added points.
2. Wrote code to analyze the password if it contains upper and lower character, at least 9 digits, special characters.
3. If it contains more than 5 points strong password and if not then medium and weaker character.
4. It was all happening in terminal so I decided to code some GUI program to make it visible in window.
5. Found tkinter - a built in library in python to create GUI
6. Made a basic UI using tkinter
